### About Dataset
Where do Citi Bikers ride? When do they ride? How far do they go? Which stations are most <br>
popular? What days of the week are most rides taken on? We've heard all of these questions and <br>
more from you, and we're happy to provide the data to help you discover the answers to these <br> 
questions and more. We invite developers, engineers, statisticians, artists, academics, and other <br>
interested members of the public to use the data we provide for analysis, development, <br>
visualization and w and whatever else moves you.
